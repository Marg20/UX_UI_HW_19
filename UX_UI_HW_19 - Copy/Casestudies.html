    The Challenge

  </div>


  <div class="case-study-section-body-1">
    Humane Society of Utah is a big Organazation based in  Utah. The website redesign was a difficult one since the website is already an updated one. We interviewed more than 50 people and we figured out that the majority of them did not know about the services that HSU offers

User Insight

</h2>


<img src="" alt ="" />


<div class="case-study-section-body-2">
  Elizabeth wants to have the benefits of being a pet owner, but owning a pet is often difficult because of lack of time, determination and expense. People with many hours of work are affected by this problem. How might we help people or families enjoy the company of a pet so they will be able to benefit from it and avoid giving up on their pet.

</div>

<div class="case-study-section-body-2">
  The affinity diagram helped us develop our user persona. Elizabeth, a 38 year old woman from Salt Lake City is married with young children. Elizabeth loves animals and often stops to say hi to dog. She wants to make sure that she provides a nice and happy home for all the family, especially the fury kiddos. She likes to shop on discounts since the family is a family of 7.Elizabeth wants to be able and volunteer in the local shelter but that contaudicts with he carrer goal,since time is never enough. She and her husband recently decided that they would like to add another member into the family.  She would love to adopt a dog, but she is scared that she won’t be able to take proper care of the new pet nor be able to train it since she needs to works long hours. She needs a way that would help her keep her pet healthy and happy without being very expensive.
